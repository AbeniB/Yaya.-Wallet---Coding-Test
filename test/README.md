This is for tesing the api endpoint,
how it works, how to send a request and what data is returned
just so i know how i will plan my next step which is how to setup my backend and frontend.

in this phase:
I first used postman to get the gist of how your api request works
then created this test to try and find out how to write the backend

You can run this test in the cli
first run npm i
then run node test_api.js
