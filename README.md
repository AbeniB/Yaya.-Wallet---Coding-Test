This is a commit for tesing the api endpoint,
how it works, how to send a request and what data is returned
just so i know how i will plan my next step which is how to setup my backend and frontend.

in this phase:
Kept secrets in environment variables.
Used native node crypto module proper HMAC with SHA-256 Including a timestamp to prevent replay attacks.
Used secure communication (HTTPS).
